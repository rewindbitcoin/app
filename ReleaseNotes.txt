Release Version Beta v1.1.4

Enhancements:

- Community Backups:
  - Introducing Community Backups! Encrypted backups are now stored in a decentralized P2P network, ensuring your wallet's technical information (descriptors and vaults) remains safe, even if Rewind Bitcoin ceases operations.
  - The encryption key for backups is derived from your mnemonic, so securely storing your mnemonic is all that’s required. There’s no need for complex descriptor storage on USB devices, cloud services like Google Cloud or Apple iCloud, or reliance on third-party providers.
  - This extends the simplicity of traditional wallets (BIP32/BIP39) to the powerful capabilities of Miniscript.
  - Learn more at https://rewindbitcoin.com/community-backups.

- Improved Vault Usability:
  - When no non-hidden vaults exist, the app now displays helpful prompts.


Release Version Beta v1.1.3

Enhancements:

- UX Improvements:
  - Emergency Addresses are now pre-filled by default, with contextual help provided.
  - The app is more resilient: it operates independently even if backend services (e.g., BTC-to-fiat rates) are unavailable or the backend goes offline. Essential functionalities like unfreezing and emergency fund recovery remain unaffected.
  - Reduced network usage to optimize performance and minimize data consumption.

- Robustness to Network Errors:
  - Automated and reasonable retries for network failures.
  - Improved handling of Electrum node disconnections.
  - Friendly, actionable error messages for poor connectivity.
  - Optimized timeouts for better performance in weak network conditions.
  - Avoids unnecessary network usage while the app is in the background and resumes seamlessly when restored to the foreground.

- Error Messaging:
  - Enhanced feedback for permissions-related issues (e.g., Biometrics and Camera). Clear instructions are provided for re-enabling access if initially denied.
  - General error messages are now more user-friendly.

- Responsiveness Improvements:
  - Receive and Freeze buttons now appear only when all necessary data is ready, improving screen responsiveness.
  - Better performance for older Android devices with animations disabled.

Fixes:

- Real-time transaction history updates when new transactions are received while the History Tab is focused.
- Resolved settings panel issues where certain options (e.g., long Electrum URLs) could not be set correctly.
- Fixed a crash caused by sudden Electrum node disconnections.
- Addressed minor formatting inconsistencies.
- Improved fee estimation retrieval by removing reliance on specific server response formats.
- Prevented unintended pull-to-refresh animations during background wallet refreshes.

Developer Features:
- Added more options in the settings menu for easier testing and debugging.

Additional Improvements:
- Faster notifications for faucet activity.
- Refined user experience for older or slower devices.

This release enhances reliability, usability, and performance while maintaining robust functionality under challenging conditions.
Thank you for testing RewindBitcoin!
