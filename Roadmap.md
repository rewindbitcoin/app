The Share process:

Option 1) Store the data in the server


- Create the JSON
- Create a Random password
- Encode the JSON
- Upload it to thunderden.com
- Create a link: https://thunderden.com/joseluis#password
- Share a text: Pass this link to anyone. Anyone with this link can use it to Cancel a transaction so be wise. The cancellation data is stored in ThunderDen (but encrypted). The data is removed as soon as the user accesses it and stores the data.


Option 2) Pass the .json data.
- Create the JSON
- Share the JSON and tell people they must use recovery.thunderden.com
- Then in the App add, do you want to notify others when Trigger?


- Using the email is better in the sense that oyu know who clicked on the Panic Button.
